            In the article, the author uses different diagrams illustrating both 2D and 3D models
            of the Internet under various conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="intro wrapper2">For each section of the article, the website has got a floating window with several diagrams
            for detailed explanation that varies while scrolling, and a fixed background with mainly text.

        <p class="t1">With Quotes</p>
        <p class="q1"><span class="qColor">“The strength of the Internet is a concentration of power in a single point incorporating the whole world”
        </span>-It’s quite thought-provoking to me. Undoubtedly, the Internet has gathered power all around the world, but I would illustrate it as innumerable points instead of one single point which sounds somehow restricted.
        </p>
        <p class="q1"><span class="qColor">“Search engine controls internet architecture”</span> (like Google) is a point I
        found interesting. Combining it with another quote in the next paragraph<span class="qColor">“Internet adapts 
            itself to suit the realities of each region”</span>, together they discuss the problem of visibility--what
        we are able to see, and what each country wants their people to see.</p>
        <p class="q2">The article claims, <span class="qColor">“The weight of the internet is concentrated solely at one focal point”</span>, leads to
         the concept of <span class="qColor">“super-jurisdiction”</span>, which the U.S has got due to its unique position. </p>
         <p class="q2">The author claimed the Internet <span class="qColor">“exists physically”</span> and is <span class="qColor">“buried underground”</span>, metaphorizing it as a mind that needs a body. 
            I’d consider the opposite—what makes the Internet elusively appear at any moment in human life and build strong connections between 
            individuals that seem completely irrelevant is its characteristic of no physical restrictions.</p>
            <p class="q3"><span class="qColor">“Being on Internet means being traceable”</span>and <span class="qColor">“we are not the clients but the products”</span>
                deliver an intriguing concept of personal data, or our digital personality. This actually is what I have considered for a long period. 
                While reflecting personal interests and concerns, these data might also show an individual’s own personality, helping the Internet to “visualize” humans. 
                I’m wondering if the data is suitable for use in creating the AI version of an individual, which (seems to) target promoting humanity. 
                Some people use the internet merely as a tool for mission completion, while others who use the internet for abreaction exist. Under these intricate situations, 
                it’s difficult to tell if they want “the passive personal data” to represent themselves.</p>
